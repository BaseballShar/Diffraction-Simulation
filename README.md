# Diffraction Simulation

### Description:
- This is a diffraction simluation program, it can simulate diffraction patterns produced by a rectangular slit or a circular aperture.

### Simulation features:
1. **Variable dimension**
- This program allows various wavelength to slit size ratio to be inputted, from 5 to 25.

2. **Colour gradient Tuning**
- This program adjusts the colour gradient of the simulation according to the dimension of the slit for better visual demostration.

### Usage
1. Launch MatLab
2. Navigate to the program folder
3. Execute diffRectangular(widthToLength) for a rectangular slit, with widthToLength being the slit width to the wavelength of light.
4. Execute diffCircular(radiusToLength) for a circular aperture, with radiusToLength being the radius of aperture to the wavelength of light.
